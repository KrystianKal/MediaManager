# MediaManager

### Work In Progress ###

Self-hosted webapp written in F# and Rect/NextJs made for organizing media (photos, pdfs, videos)
Supports tagging, and managing collections.

Server tracks local directories for changes and updates the data model live.

F# application uses [Railway Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) to create secure pipelines.

Frontend app uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) component library.

App will employ extensive fuzzy recommendation/search based on tags and metadata
including color information (for videos and images).
