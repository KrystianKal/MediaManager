# MediaManager

### Work In Progress ###

Self-hosted, locally run, webapp written in F# and Rect/NextJs made for organizing media (photos, pdfs, movies).
App allows for tagging, managing collections, thumbnail generation and metadata extraction.

Server tracks local directories for changes and updates the data model live.

F# application uses [Railway Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) to create secure pipelines.

Frontend app uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) component library.

App will employ extensive fuzzy recommendation/search based on tags, collections and metadata
including color information (for videos and images).
